        <h3 class="card-header">Grilled Peach Barrata Salad</h3>
    </a>
    <p class="card-content">
        Ingredients: 
        8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)  
        1/2 teaspoon salt
        1/8 teaspoon black pepper
        1 1/2 cups salsa verde, either jarred or homemade, divided
        Oil, for the grill --

       Prepare the chicken:
       With scissors or a sharp knife, trim the excess skin and fat from the thighs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides.
       
       Marinate the chicken:
       In a bowl, toss the chicken with 1 cup of the salsa verde to coat. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to overnight.
       
       Prepare the grill:
       If you are using a gas grill, set one side to high temperature and the other side to low temperature. Heat the grill to at least 450°F.
       If you are using a charcoal grill, prepare a two-level fire by mounding the coals on one side of the grill, and leaving the second side empty.
       When your grill is hot, use tongs to oil the grill grates with a small folded piece of paper towel dipped in oil.
       
       Grill the chicken:
       Remove the chicken from the marinade. Place the thighs on the hot side of the grill, skin-side down. Cook them for a minute or two—just long enough for the skin to show the grill marks. Flip over and sear briefly on the other side. (Exact timing depends on the heat of your particular grill.)
       Move the chicken to the cooler side of the grill. Continue to cook, turning once or twice, for about 6 to 8 minutes or until the temperature in thickest part of the chicken registers 165oF. Transfer the chicken to a platter and let it rest for 10 minutes.

       Serve the chicken:
       Transfer the chicken to a platter or individual plates. Serve with the remaining 1/2 cup salsa verde on the side and your choice of toppings.

        <h3 class="card-header">Simple Summer Tomato Salad</h3>
    </a>
    <p class="card-content">
     Ingredients 
     For the vinaigrette
     2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
     1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
     1 teaspoon honey
     1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
     For the salad
     1/4 medium red onion, very thinly sliced
     2 pounds ripe tomatoes, any and all varieties welcome
     1 teaspoon kosher salt
     Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
     1/4 cup fresh basil, chiffonade
     2 tablespoons fresh mint, chiffonade

     Make the vinaigrette: 
     In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, and honey until the honey dissolves. Whisk in the olive oil until blended.

     Macerate the red onions:
     Add the sliced onions into the vinaigrette and tuck them down into the dressing. Set aside to macerate while you assemble the salad.

     Cut the tomatoes:
     Trim out the stem and base of the stem from the tomatoes. Cut tomatoes into 1/2-inch-thick slices. If you’re including some cherry tomatoes, cut in half.

     Assemble the salad and serve:
     Arrange the tomatoes on a large plate or medium platter and season both sides with salt. Lightly shower with freshly ground black pepper. 
     Pour the dressing and onions over the salad. Use your hands to gently nestle the tomatoes in the dressing and distribute the onions evenly. Scatter with basil and mint. Taste and add more salt and/or pepper, if needed. 
     Serve immediately.

     Storage:
     This salad is best the day it’s made, but can be enjoyed a day or two later if covered well and stored in the fridge.
